# • Use cases of automation and scripting
## - User provisioning - reduces the risk of unathorized access,improves compliance, and saves time by minimizing the manual workload
## - Resource provisioning - allocates and manages IT resources like compute,storage, and network services to meet organizational needs. It helps improve agility, optimize resource use
## - Guard rails - automated verification of information going into a system. Stops human error. 
## - Security groups - assign and remove group access. Constant audits without human intervention.
## - Ticket creation - Automatically identifify issues. Script email submissions into a ticket.
## - Escalation - Correct issues before involving a human. If issue isn't resolved , contact the on call tech
## - Enabling/disabling services and access - automation that's used to enable a service needs to be used for a certain amount of time and when time is complete it can be disabled with out any human intervention.
## - Continuous integration and testing - Constant developement and code updates. Securely test and deploy
## - Integrations and Application programming interfaces (APIs) - Interact with third-party devices and services. Cloud services,firewalls, and operating systems. Talk their languages
# • Benefits
## - Efficiency/time saving - No typing required for scripting. Run multiple times, over and over.
## - Enforcing baselines - Missing an Important security patch. Automatically install when identified.
## - Standard infrastructure configurations - Use a script to build a default router config. Add firewall rules to a new security appliance. Ip config. security rules, standard  config. options.
## - Scaling in a secure manner - Orchestrate cloud resources, quickly scale up and down. automation ensures proper security also scales.
## - Employee retention - Automate the boring stuff, ease the workload, minimize the mundane task, and the employees work is rewarding instead of repetitive.
## - Reaction time - The computer is faster than humans, an event can be addressed immediately because a script doesn't need a wake up call. 
## - Workforce multiplier - Scripts run 24/7 allowing people do other work elsewhere
# • Other considerations
## - Complexity - Many moving parts. All of the parts have to reliably work together.
## - Cost - It takes money to create script as well as implement the automation.
## - Single point of failure - What happens when the script stops working? This can also be a significant deal-breaker.
## - Technical debt - Patching problems may push the issue down the road. it's going to be more expensive to fix later
## - Ongoing supportability - The script can work today and may not work tomorrow. Plan for changes and updates
